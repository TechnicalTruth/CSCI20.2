    /*  
        "10 points assigned to player" 
        this is done by initializing a variable representative of the 
        player and assigning it an inital value of '10'
    
        "Computer chooses a number between 1 and 100"
        
        "User guesses a number" 
        creating an 'cin' statement to allow input from player
        
        "If user is correct they win" 
        if statement condition 'usrIn = number generated' output 'You Win'
        
        "If user is incorrect the computer tells them if the number is higher 
        or lower than their selection"
        
        
        "Program resets and asks user to guess once again"
        else statement stating 'please try again' and creating user input
        
        "Program subtracts a point off of the players current amount" 
        setting user variable equal to itself minus one
        
        "Repeat until user is correct"
        this is done by creating a loop
